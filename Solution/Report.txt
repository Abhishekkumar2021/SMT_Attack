This Project is to find the true keys out of the locked C code.
Algorithm Used : SMT attack
Tools Used : SMT solver(Z3Py), Python, C code
Result : The true keys are found out and present in keys.txt file.

Complete algorithm step by step:
1. We generated a new SMT solver instance.
2. We created a new variable for each keys, Inputs, and Outputs and intermedite variables.
3. We added the constraints for each keys, Inputs, and Outputs and intermedite variables.
4. And run the check() sat function to find the DIP.
5. If we find the DIP, we will find the correct output using the ./motion.exe (blackbox) and then added more constraints to the SMT solver to remove wrong keys out of space.
6. We will repeat the step 4 and 5 until we find the true keys.

The SMT solver will find the DIP and the correct output for each keys.
